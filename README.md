# India Air Quality Analysis – February 19, 2024, 10:00 AM

Air pollution is one of the most critical environmental and public health challenges facing India today. With rapid urbanization, industrial growth, and increased vehicular emissions, air quality has deteriorated significantly across urban and rural landscapes. This project presents an in-depth, data-driven assessment of India’s Air Quality Index (AQI) at a specific timestamp — **February 19, 2024, 10:00 AM** — using real-time pollutant data from monitoring stations across the country.

---

## Objectives

- Analyze AQI and pollutant concentrations across Indian states and cities.
- Compare air quality patterns between:
  - **Metro vs. Tier-2 cities**
  - **Coastal vs. Inland regions**
  - **Active vs. Inactive monitoring stations**
- Identify pollution hotspots and regional disparities.
- Provide actionable insights for environmental planning and policy formulation.

## Pollutants Analyzed

The AQI is computed based on the concentration of the following key pollutants:

- **CO** – Carbon Monoxide
- **NH₃** – Ammonia
- **NO₂** – Nitrogen Dioxide
- **O₃** – Ozone
- **PM₁₀** – Particulate Matter (diameter ≤ 10 μm)
- **PM₂.₅** – Particulate Matter (diameter ≤ 2.5 μm)
- **SO₂** – Sulfur Dioxide

## Analysis Dimensions

The analysis spans multiple spatial and categorical dimensions:

- **State-wise AQI breakdown**
- **City-level comparisons**
- **Metro vs. Tier-2 classifications**
- **Coastal vs. Inland geographic zones**
- **Monitoring station activity (number of active stations)**
