# Air-Quality-Disparities
This project presents a data-driven analysis of India's air quality using real-time AQI data. It covers pollutant levels (CO, NH₃, NO₂, O₃, PM₁₀, PM₂.₅, SO₂) across cities and states, analyzing metro vs. tier-2, coastal vs. inland, and station activity to identify hotspots and guide policy.
